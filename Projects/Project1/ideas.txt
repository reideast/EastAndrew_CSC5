Rocket Launch
guess how much thrust you need to launch a rocket up out of the atmosphere
-and how long the burn is
challenge because more thrust realistically adds more fuel weight (there's a formula for this, right?)
three difficulty levels: just the rocket, small payload, and heavy payload

Inputs:
thrust
-constant vs. variable??
time of thrust in seconds
-> calculate fuel weight
    -changes over time as fuel is burnt up? (formula?)
maybe change type of engine? liquid, solid, boosters, sci-fi (ion, nuclear (Fallout reference))

Calculation:
Height as function of time & thrust & fuel

Draw Screen:
how to CLS a C++ terminal?? to make frames
-write 30+ endl?
how many FPS can I do?

DrawScreen(x, y, time, height, fuel)
- puts the "rocket" ASCII character at x,y on terminal screen
- writes the data
- called once per frame

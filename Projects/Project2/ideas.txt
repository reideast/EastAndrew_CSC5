text-based rpg (zork)
RPG with controls, like Rogue
life
life vs. battleship
  human is battleship
  CPU is alien invader that follows rules of Conway's game of life
  human places ships, then spends turn eradicating ~5 squares of life
  CPU starts with random life squares all over the board, then can intelligently place squres each turn
  After CPU goes, run life for ~10 cycles
  If a square of a ship spends a certain amount of time under a LIFE square, it looses a hit point
  If a square looses ~3 hit points, it is a HIT
  Ships get HIT and SINK just like in Battleship

//Function Prototypes
//buyAnItem: Let a user insert coins into a machine until they have spent enough to buy it
bool buyAnItem(int itemPrice, int& change);
//Preconditions:
//  itemPrice is the item's cost in cents (must be in multiples of 5 cents, since this machine doesn't take pennies)
//  change is an initialized variable
//Postconditions:
//  returns true if the item was successfully bought
//  returns false if the user canceled the transaction
//  change will contain any money due back to the customer in cents

//insertACoin: Asks the user to insert one valid coin or cancel the transaction
int insertACoin();
//Preconditions:
//  getInput function is available
//Postconditions:
//  returns the value of the coin inserted in cents
//  returns a negative number if the user canceled the whole transaction

//itemPriceReached: Determines if enough money has been inserted to purchase an item
bool itemPriceReached(int price, int moneyIn, int& change);
//Preconditions:
//  price is the cost of the item in dollars
//  moneyIn is the total money in dollars
//  change is an initialized variable
//Postconditions:
//  returns true if moneyIn is enough to purchase the item at price dollars
//    and change will be set to any dollars over the purchase price
//  returns false if more money is needed
//    and change will not be modified

//Preconditions:
//  prompt contains something to display through cout.
//  input is an initialized variable.
//  min/max contains the range desired (inclusive)
//    if not included, min/max will be zero to the largest integer on this system (calculated a bit shift based on the number of bytes in an int, then inversion (only works on two's complement based systems!))
//    for a float, a hard-coded value of 1.0e38f is chosen (based on windows 7 x64 g++ machine)
//Postconditions:
//  input will contain a valid value within the range
